It runs on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller and is currently supported on boards like the LILYGO TQT Pro. It allows users and developers to create their own apps, watch faces, and other features.</p> </li> <li> <p>OpenTimeWatch 1 (Hardware): This is our own custom-designed smartwatch circuit board (PCB). The hardware files are also open-source, allowing you to see exactly how the watch is built. It's designed to be a simple, feature-rich base for future development.</p> </li> </ol> <p>We are bringing a change to smartwatches by making the entire platform\u2014from the hardware to the look and feel of the software\u2014fully transparent and customizable.
